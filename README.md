Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room Client required me to create a mobile application for their web based game and wanted the application to be available for both Android and Apple users. The client, The Gaming Room, asked for me to create their game Draw It or Lose It. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe that I did well describing the importance of cost and hardware reccomendations for the client to lay out the best possible options to create Draw It or Lose It on mobile.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through a design document helped me with the coding because it kept me organized. It also took a lot of the stress off of my shoulders when everything was basically right in front of me the whole time because of the design document. There were little to no errors with the coding as well because of the organization of the design document. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think that I would like to improve the code a little more and I would do that by adding in more developer comments and I would fix some areas that I thought were too messy.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs and implented them by really understanding what the client was asking for. This is important because if you go outside of budget or you don't take any input from the user then the application could end up being something completely different than what they wanted, or you could end up messing up and making the hardware needed too powerful for a mobile application. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I apporached designing software very carefully but optimistic. I would honestly do the same exacat things that I did with this software design because I felt that it was one of my best yet, but implementing a more concise UML diagram could help out a lot more with describing variables.
